1. Structured Data Extraction
Concept Overview
Structured data extraction involves systematically scraping specific information
from websites and organizing it into standardized formats suitable for storage
and analysis.
Problem It Solves
While general web scraping retrieves all content, applications often need only
specific structured information (like people profiles, product details, or financial
data) in consistent formats for analysis and display.
Solution Approach
● Targeted Extraction: Focusing on specific data points rather than entire
pages
● Schema Definition: Creating clear data models for extracted information
All rights reserved Copyright 2025 Amzur 1

● Pattern Matching: Using consistent selectors and patterns to extract similar
data across pages
● Data Validation: Ensuring extracted data conforms to expected formats and
constraints
Common Pitfalls
● Brittle Selectors: Using CSS selectors that break when website structure
changes
● Missing Error Handling: Not accounting for missing or malformed data in
source websites
● Rate Limiting Issues: Sending too many requests too quickly, triggering IP
blocks
● Incomplete Schema Design: Creating data models that don't capture all
necessary information
● Validation Gaps: Not properly validating extracted data against expected
formats
● Ethics and Legal Issues: Not respecting robots.txt, terms of service, or
copyright restrictions

2. Knowledge Base Design and Management
Concept Overview
Knowledge base design involves creating structured storage systems for
domain-specific information with efficient search and retrieval capabilities.
Problem It Solves
Applications need to store, organize, and quickly retrieve information for user
queries without complex database infrastructure, especially when operating on
limited knowledge domains.
Solution Approach
● Simple Storage: Using file-based storage (JSON) or lightweight databases
(SQLite)
● Search Indexing: Creating text indices for efficient retrieval
● Categorization: Organizing information by meaningful attributes
● Metadata Enhancement: Adding additional contextual information to
improve search
Common Pitfalls
● Schema Rigidity: Creating overly rigid schemas that can't evolve with
changing requirements
● Missing Indexes: Not properly indexing fields used for frequent searches,
causing performance issues

● Connection Management: Not properly closing database connections,
leading to resource leaks
● Over-normalization: Creating too many related tables for a simple knowledge
base, adding complexity
● Inadequate Backup: Not implementing proper backup strategies for
knowledge base content
● Text Search Limitations: Not understanding the limitations of full-text search
implementations

3. Context-Aware AI Responses
Concept Overview
Context-aware AI responses involve generating answers that are informed by
and limited to a specific knowledge domain, creating more accurate and
relevant responses for domain-specific applications.
Problem It Solves
General-purpose AI models often provide generic responses that may be
irrelevant, include hallucinated information, or go beyond the specific
knowledge domain of an application.
Solution Approach
● Knowledge Grounding: Limiting AI responses to information contained in the
knowledge base
● Relevance Matching: Finding the most relevant knowledge for a given query
● Response Construction: Formulating natural language responses based on
retrieved knowledge
● Scope Detection: Determining if a query is answerable within the available
knowledge
4. Data Categorization and Organization
Concept Overview
Data categorization and organization involves structuring information into
logical groups and hierarchies to facilitate navigation, filtering, and retrieval.
Problem It Solves
All rights reserved Copyright 2025 Amzur 5

Raw data storage makes it difficult for users to browse, explore, and find
relevant information without knowing exactly what they're looking for,
especially in large datasets.
Solution Approach
● Hierarchical Organization: Arranging data in meaningful hierarchies (e.g., by
department)
● Faceted Classification: Creating multiple ways to filter and view the same
data
● Tag-Based Systems: Using tags or attributes for flexible, multi-dimensional
organization
● User-Friendly Navigation: Building interfaces that reveal organizational
structure
5. Intelligent Query Processing
Concept Overview
Intelligent query processing involves analyzing user questions to understand
intent, extract key information, and route to appropriate knowledge resources.
Problem It Solves
Natural language questions are ambiguous and may not match the exact
structure or keywords of stored information, making direct text matching
insufficient for accurate information retrieval.
Solution Approach
● Query Understanding: Analyzing user questions for intent and key entities
● Query Expansion: Adding related terms and synonyms to improve matching
● Semantic Search: Using embeddings or semantic understanding rather than
exact keywords
All rights reserved Copyright 2025 Amzur 6

● Relevance Ranking: Scoring and ordering results by likelihood of matching
user intent
Visual Diagram
Common Pitfalls
● Over-reliance on Keywords: Focusing too much on keyword matching rather
than semantic understanding
● Missing Context: Not considering the conversational context when
processing queries
● Poor Ranking: Returning results based on simple similarity without
considering relevance to intent
● Ignoring Ambiguity: Not handling cases where multiple interpretations of a
query are possible

7. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
All rights reserved Copyright 2025 Amzur 7

Concept Overview
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines information retrieval with
generative AI to produce responses that are both contextually relevant and
factually grounded in specific knowledge sources.
Problem It Solves
Large language models often hallucinate or provide generic information when
domain-specific accuracy is required, while lacking the ability to reference the
most up-to-date or specialized information not in their training data.
Solution Approach
● Knowledge Retrieval: Fetching relevant information from structured
repositories based on the query
● Context Augmentation: Incorporating retrieved information into prompts for
more informed responses
● Source Attribution: Providing citations and references to knowledge sources
● Response Generation: Using LLMs to synthesize natural language responses
from the enhanced context

Common Pitfalls
● Retrieval-Generation Mismatch: When retrieved information doesn't match
what the LLM needs to answer the question
● Prompt Overflow: Including too much retrieved information, exceeding token
limits
● Citation Hallucination: LLM referencing non-existent sources or sections
● Irrelevant Retrieval: Retrieving information that seems semantically similar
but is actually irrelevant to the query intent
● Conflicting Information: Not handling contradictions between different
retrieved sources

8. Scope-Aware Conversational Interfaces
Concept Overview
Scope-aware conversational interfaces provide natural language interactions
while maintaining awareness of the system's knowledge boundaries, gracefully
handling out-of-scope questions.
Problem It Solves
Traditional chatbots either hallucinate answers to unknown questions or
provide jarring "I don't know" responses without helpful guidance, leading to
poor user experience when users ask questions outside system knowledge.
Solution Approach
All rights reserved Copyright 2025 Amzur 9

● Scope Detection: Determining if questions are answerable within the
knowledge domain
● Graceful Fallbacks: Providing helpful responses when questions are out of
scope
● Suggested Alternatives: Recommending related in-scope questions users
might want to ask
● Progressive Discovery: Helping users understand what the system can and
cannot answer
